class Brick:
    """
    Conceptually, bricks are intended to populate (or sparsely populate)
    a Grid, with no more than one Brick per grid block.

    The particular Grid block in which a Brick lives is indicated by it's logical_box,
    which always encompasses an exact (complete) grid block region.

    But for some Bricks, there may not be enough data to fill the entire Grid block
    (e.g. for Bricks that lie on the edge of a large volume's bounding-box).
    In that case, the Brick.volume array might only span a subregion within the logical_box.
    That region is indicated by the Brick's physical_box.

    In fact, a Brick's physical_box may even be *larger* than it's logical_box,
    which is useful for operations in which Brick data needs to be padded with some 'halo'.

    In Summary, a Brick consists of three items:

        - volume: An array of voxels, i.e. the actual data for the Brick

        - physical_box: The region in space that those voxels inhabit.
                        By definition, `volume.shape == (physical_box[1] - physical_box[0])`

        - logical_box: The Brick's logical address within some abstract Grid in space.

        Note: Both boxes (logical and physical) are always stored in GLOBAL coordinates.

                Bricks with the same logical_box must have the identical location_id.
                Can be the same as logical_box, but for certain operations,
                better hashing can be achieved using IDs with certain properties.
                The most important property is that the IDs in a set of bricks are
