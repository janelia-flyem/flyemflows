        Computes connected components across an entire volume,
        possibly considering only a subset of all labels,
        and writes the result to another volume.
        
        (Even if only some labels were analyzed for CC, all labels are written to the output.)
        
        Objects that were not "disconnected" in the first place are not modified.
        Their voxels retain their original values and they are simply copied to
        the output.  Only objects which consist of multiple disconnected pieces
        are given new label values.

        In addition to exporting a few intermediate dataframes for debugging purposes,
        this workflow also exports the final table of all objects that were relabeled
        in the output, with the IDs that were used to compute the table for every
        processed brick.  The table is written to 'node_df_final.pkl'

        Note:
            The table does NOT include components that didn't need to
            be re-written at all. (This workflow does not alter labels
            that consisted of only one component to begin with.)

                The global component ID after unifying cc labels across neighboring bricks
            final_cc:
                The final component label written to the output.
                Computed my mapping the link_cc values into the correct output
                label range as determined by orig-max-label

        Procedure Overview:

        1. Accepts any segmentation volume as input, divided into
           'bricks' as usual, but with a halo of at least 1 voxel.
        
        2. Computes connected components (CC) on each brick independently.
           Note: Before computing the CC, the "subset-labels" setting is used to
           mask out everything except the desired objects.
           Note that the resulting CC labels for each brick are not unique -- each
           brick has values of 1..cc_max.
           Also, the original label from which each CC label was created is stored in
           the "overlap mapping" (dataframe for each brick with columns: ['cc', 'orig']).
           The CC volume, overlap mapping, cc_max, and raw data max
           for each brick are cached (persisted).
        
        3. The CC values are made unique across all bricks by adding an offset to each brick.
           The offset is determined by multiplying the brick's ID number (scan-order index)
           with the maximum CC value found in all the brick CC volumes.
           Note: This means that the CC values will be unique, but not consecutive across all bricks.
           The overlap mapping (cc->orig) is also updated accordingly.
        
        4. Next, we need to determine how to unify objects which span across brick boundaries.
           First, the halos from each brick are extracted and matched with the halos from 
           their neighboring bricks. This is achieved via a dask DataFrame merge.
           Then these halo pairs are aligned so that the CC label in the "left" halo can
           be matched with the CC label in the "right" halo.
           These pairings "link" the CC objects in one brick to another brick,
           and are referred to as "pairwise links".
        
        5. These links form the edges of a graph, and the connected components *on the graph*
           determine which CC labels should be unified in the output.
           Note that here, we are referring to a graph-CC, not to be confused with the
           connected components operations we ran earlier, on each brick's volume data.
           This graph-CC operation yields a "final mapping" from brick-CC labels to unified
           label values.
           Note: Since we are not interested in relabeling objects that weren't
           discontiguous in the original volume, we drop rows of the mapping for objects whose
           'orig' value only appears once in the final mapping.  This reduces the size of the
           mapping, which must be sent to the workers.  In fact, before we even run the graph-CC
           operation, we drop CC values if their original label doesn't appear more than once in
           the overlap mapping from above. This reduces the size of the graph-CC problem.
        
        6. The final mapping is distrbuted to all workers in pieces, via pandas DataFrame merge.
        
        7. The final mapping is applied to the CC bricks, and written to the output.
           If the "subset-labels" option was used, the CC brick may consist of zeros for those
           voxels that did not contain a label of interest (see step 1, above).  But the output
           is guaranteed to contain all of the unsplit original objects, so we use the original
           volume to supply the remaining data before it is written to the output.
